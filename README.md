Jellyfish in the ocean - meditation and study focus
------------------------------------------------------
1. Link for multiple jellyfish (used for landscape video format): https://editor.p5js.org/LuciaMahutova/full/NT0C3bDKy
2. Link for single jellyfish (used for portrait video format): https://editor.p5js.org/LuciaMahutova/full/tyyly_hnO

------------------------------------------------------
CONCEPT:
Make something calm for meditation to reduce everyday stress - simulate Jellyfish and their natural movement in the water, eg. by using Bezier curves. 

FINAL CONCEPT:
Many of us work in a stressful environment and sometimes it can be hard to stay focused and calm during studying. In order to reduce stress and stay focused to finish what we started, it can be helpful to trick our mind by using our peripheral vision. Simply play the calming simulation with meditation music at the background or on the second screen and stay calm and focused on the work, based on what you need.

6 KEYBOARDS:
Nature, water, meditation, stress relief, studying, simulation
